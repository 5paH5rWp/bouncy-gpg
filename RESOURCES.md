# Additional resources

The documentation of gpg does exist, but is not always readily available. This document
serves as a quick lookup list for interesting resources.

## Keys

* [Anatomy of a GPG Key
](https://davesteele.github.io/gpg/2014/09/20/anatomy-of-a-gpg-key/) - a good explanation of GPG
* [RFC4880 OpenPGP Message Format](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880)
* The description of gpg output format  is found in the [DETAILS](https://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=gnupg.git;a=blob_plain;f=doc/DETAILS) file.
* Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange maintain a list of secure elliptic curves at
 [safecurves.cr.yp.to](https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/).
