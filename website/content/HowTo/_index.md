Even with a library like BouncyGPG it is impossible to correctly use the cryptography toolbox without a bit of theoretical background. The HOWTOs will give solid implementation guidelines regarding selected use cases.

The provide example code can act as starting point for your implementations.

Reading the use cases will provide you with enough information to implement them for "normal security" applications. For high security applications, e.g. when the life of people is at stake involve a cryptographer!
