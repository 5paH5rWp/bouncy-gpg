      <description>Most systems use passwords to create (derive) cryptographic keys, e.g. the password to decrypt a ZIP file is used to create a cryptographic key.
The process of creating a cryptographic key from a password is called password based key derivation. Because passwords are often to short/predictable this derivation often also implements some kind of key strengthening or key stretching (see below for more info).
To properly derive a key from a passwords a few aspects are important to consider.</description>
